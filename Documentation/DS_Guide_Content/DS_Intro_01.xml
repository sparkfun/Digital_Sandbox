<Welcome_Title>Welcome to the Digital Sandbox!</Welcome_Title>
<Welcome_Text>This guide, partnered with the Digital Sandbox, helps to introduce fundamental concepts of both programming and electronics. Using ArduBlock – a simple, graphical version of the popular Arduino programming language – you will program 13 experiments that progressively explore subjects like digital inputs, analog outputs, serial communication and more. The experiments are project-based, with goals of inspiring inventions like reaction-testing games, automatic night lights, adjustable volume meters, and more.</Welcome_Text>

<Download_Title>Download the Arduino/ArduBlock Combo</Download_Title>
<Download_Text>Arduino and ArduBlock are available for all popular operating system flavors. Make sure you grab the version that matches your operating system:
Windows (ZIP File)
Mac OS X
The Arduino software comes packaged in an archived .ZIP format. Once you’ve downloaded the ZIP file, you’ll need to extract it. Mac users should move the Arduino application into the Applications folder, and Windows users can move the Arduino folder to a preferred location as well.</Download_Text>
<Install_Drivers_Title>Install Drivers</Install_Drivers_Title>
<Install_Drivers_Text>Once you have downloaded and extracted the Arduino software connect the Digital Sandbox to your computer.

Once the board is connected, you will need to install drivers. Please go to https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ftdi-drivers for instructions specific to your operating system.</Install_Drivers_Text>
<Open_Arduino_And_ArduBlock_Title>Open Arduino and ArduBlock</Open_Arduino_And_ArduBlock_Title>
<Open_Arduino_And_ArduBlock_Text>ArduBlock is an addon that exists inside the Arduino software. To open it up, first open the Arduino IDE. Windows users should run Arduino.exe, Mac users can run the Arduino application.
Let’s do some preparation before opening ArduBlock. First, go to the Tools menu, hover over Board and select Digital SandBox.
Tools > Board > Digital Sandbox
Next, go back to the Tools menu, hover over Serial Port and select the serial port number that matches your Sandbox board.
Add serial port select image similar to SIK guide
Finally, to open ArduBlock, go to Tools and select ArduBlock.
Tools > ArduBlock
What opens next is the ArduBlock interface. Make sure the Arduino window remains running in the background. If you close that, ArduBlock will close as well.

Note: If you don’t see ArduBlock under the Tools menu, you may need to manually install it. Please visit ??? for help adding ArduBlock to a previous Arduino installation.</Open_Arduino_And_ArduBlock_Text>
